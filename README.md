Required: Python3/Tkinter - Pyinotify - (the included TkinterDnD2).

At the moment the only component is the desktop. The next is a panel. It starts as a window, but has the code tu run it as a desktop (background application): just comment and decomment the right lines at the bottom of the file tkdesktop.py. Tkdesktop manages all the events but do not change nothing by itself, exept its config file: icon can be placed everywhere (except the recycle bin, its position is fixed and reserved), an icon appears if a new file or folder is created in the DATA sample folder and the item disappears if the related file or folder is deleted. The position of each item is momorized in a file.
